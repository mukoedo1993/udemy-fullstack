However, we do need to worry about the timing of our event.
When we say request.session.user, the session package is going to recognize that we are changing the session data and in response is going to automatically update that session data in database. It's great.
But, updating database is an asynchronous action. It might a while to complete. We don't want to just run redirect right here because there's no guarantee that the database
will have actually been updated in time before the redirect runs.
