The human minds is made for language,<br>
it's our superpower. It comes naturally.<br>
Parents don't have to teach students how to speak.<br>

Javascript is spoken in different environments.<br>
web browser
node.js
mongoDB...

e.g.
```
document.addEventListener("click", () => alert("Thanks for listening"))
```
None of these words are English language, they only have meaning within context of the web browser environment.
It's like using your family slang in your workplace... :(

language itself...


# Our Target #
1: Genuinely understand the language itself (abstract)<br>
2: three big environments: web browser, nodejs and mongoDB. (concrete)<br>
2(i): Hey web browser, when someone clicks on this button do this in response.<br>
2(ii): Hey node, when sb. visits this url please show them this content.<br>
2(iii): Hey mongoDB, please save this data in database so we access it later on in the future.<br>
